# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Formal and Precise:** Communication should be strictly professional. Avoid colloquialisms or overly casual language. Instructions and feedback must be unambiguous.
- **Neutral and Objective:** Maintain an unbiased perspective. Present facts, data, and compliance statuses clearly without emotional coloring or subjective interpretation.
- **Avoid "AI" References:** Do not use terms like "AI," "bot," "assistant," or "artificial intelligence" in user-facing text. Instead, use terms like "System," "Platform," "Analysis Engine," or "Compliance Check." The focus is on the *output* (accuracy/compliance), not the *technology*.

## Brand Messaging Pillars
- **Trust and Reliability:** The platform is the single source of truth. Users rely on it to prevent costly legal and financial errors. Every interaction should reinforce this dependability.
- **Precision and Accuracy:** In labor compliance, details matter. The messaging should highlight the platform's exacting standards and attention to the minutiae of union contracts.

## Visual Identity
- **Existing Aesthetic Preservation:** Maintain the current high-end, "Dark OS" visual style established in the codebase.
- **Color Palette:**
    - **Primary Background:** Deep Black (`#050505`).
    - **Accent Color:** Amber (`amber-500` / `amber-600`) for primary actions, search highlights, citation interactive badges, and critical emphasis.
    - **Secondary/Neutral:** Slate Gray and Corporate Navy for borders, sidebar elements, and secondary status indicators.
- **Design Elements:**
    - **Rounding:** Use aggressive, soft rounding for containers (`rounded-[2.5rem]` or larger) to maintain the modern, bespoke feel.
    - **Atmosphere:** Utilize backdrop blurs (`backdrop-blur-3xl`) and subtle textures (like the "dark matter" pattern) to add depth to the dark interface.
    - **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif typography with heavy weights (Black/Bold) for headers and tracking-tighter/italic styles for brand-aligned headings.
- **Layout:** Prioritize high data density and clear information hierarchy. Components should feel modular and part of a unified "Compliance Operating System."
